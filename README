This is me trying to reproduce algorithms discussed in "Design and Analysis of Algorithms 1" online curse from Stanford University.


I'm not using Java, because it requires additional jUnit library to test my algorithms (and that sucks all the way). I could consider using Python, it has build in 'unittest' lib, but after SaaS course i prefer Ruby over Python. Just because it has 'poetry mode'. :)


Anyone reading this could lose line of sight, because i'm in love with 'oneline methods' in Ruby and try to minimize, even then readibility suffers.
